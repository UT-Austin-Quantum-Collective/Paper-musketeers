# ðŸ¤ºPAPER-MUSKETEERS
This is an in progress github for anyone who was interested in wokring towards publishing an acadmeic paper under Dr.Noah Davis as part of our Research Program we are creating for the Quantum Collective.

We are creating a research program for our club. 
This program is supervised by Dr. Noah Davis. We are self-driven students
who are wanting to do collective research over the year with the intent of publishing a paper. 
This is a great opportunity to be a part of building the foundation of UT Austinâ€™s Quantum Community
and build our reputation for undergraduate research initiatives :).
