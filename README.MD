# ðŸ¤ºPAPER-MUSKETEERS 2020-2023 Program Outline

This is the UT Quantum Collectiveâ€™s first research program. This is a 6 month-long program where undergraduate students work collectively towards publishing an academic paper, working in groups to research a specific application of the yearly topic. Students will work in groups throughout the year, meeting bi-weekly with the research cohort to share updates, progress, and what they learned about their work. Students will spend a month building their background knowledge about the topic area and learning the fundamentals needed to start working effectively with their research group and build foundational skills for writing academic papers. Through this program, students will gain valuable experience in a hypothesis-driven research process, develop independent critical thinking, communication, and presentation skills, learn to work independently and build tolerance for obstacles, and make meaningful contributions to the broader scientific community of Quantum Computing Research. 

This program is intended to cultivate a group of mentors within the Quantum Collective who will have a chance to guide the program in later years and build on our core pillar of research to make the entry barrier into quantum computing accessible for undergraduate students.

# Deadline to Enroll:

After the first session when background materials will be given, you may use the two week period up to **September 26th** to see if this program is a good fit for you before team assignments are made.

# Program Benefits:

- Understanding research methodology and how scientists work on problems
- Develop skills to analyze data and interpret results
- Learn to integrate theory and practice
- Develop knowledge about a subfield within Quantum Computing, as well as hands-on experience with quantum programming
- Gain transferrable skills for STEM research and professional careers
- Credibility with research experience for graduate programs
- Participate in conferences and any undergraduate research events at UT Austin as we incorporate opportunities throughout the year.
- Become a research mentor for the next wave of @paper-musketeers in the Quantum Collective

# Fall 2022- Spring 2023 Topic (In Progress):

The general topic will be centered around variaitonal quantum algorithms to allow us to accommodate all your research interest. Background Materials will be provided following the Introductory meeting with your mentor. **We are working on one paper collectively this year, but accommodating all your research interests.**

Our goal is to submit a paper for review to a publishing venue by the end of March.

# Research Structure:

Students will be placed in groups of 4 or 5 depending on their research interests from the application form, and each team will work through the 6 months on their area of the research paper. All groups will meet bi-weekly with our mentor to share our progress, roadblocks, and have a collective space for discussion. Each team will determine the best work structure, and agree upon their expectations for communication, work ethic, and roles. Throughout the year, you will contribute to writing the body of our paper based on your application area, learning how to create a framework for a testable experiment, implement your experiment on quantum simulators and/or hardware, as well as understand best practices for analyzing your data and synthesize your results. 

Teams will each have a forked repository in GitHub from our main repository. 

Teams will have a channel on the discord server and use #paper-musketeers for a collaborative discussion space.

Your mentor will be available on discord as well as the bi-weekly meetings to help guide your research progress. 

We will try to work on bringing in more mentors throughout the year and make announcements accordingly. 

Learning resources will be provided in our resource repository to which all program participants will contribute together throughout the year.

# Expectations:

We understand that research as undergraduate research is a challenging initiative to contribute to while balancing classes. We will have no penalty nor required assignments and rely on our self-motivation and broader goal to contribute valuable scientific knowledge to the broader Quantum Computing research community. 

If at any time you feel like your research is overwhelming, please reach out to our mentor. We will determine the best steps forward for your teammates and adjust accordingly. 

We will also modify our timeline as needed based on our progress and check-in sessions.

We encourage this to be a welcoming space free from judgment and bias about your level of understanding. We are here to learn together regardless of where you start. 

# Opportunities:

Throughout the year, we will work to incorporate this program into any existing undergraduate research initiatives at UT Austin and beyond. This includes funding, conference opportunities, and any events at UT Austin where undergraduate research receives a space for disseminating your work.

# Program Timeline:

## August - Early September:

***Application and Introduction Period***

Research Introductions with The Quantum Collective at UT. Students spend this time meeting one another, thinking about their research goals and getting an overview of the program.
