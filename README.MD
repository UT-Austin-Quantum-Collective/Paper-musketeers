# ðŸ¤ºPAPER-MUSKETEERS 2020-2023 Program Outline

This is the UT Quantum Collectiveâ€™s first research program. This is a semester-long program where undergraduate students work towards publishing academic survery papers, working in groups to research a specific application based on their research interests. Students will work in groups throughout the semester, meeting bi-weekly with the research cohort to share updates, progress, and what they learned about their work. Students will spend a month building their background knowledge about the topic area and learning the fundamentals needed to start working effectively with their research group and build foundational skills for writing academic papers. Through this program, students will gain valuable experience in a hypothesis-driven research process, develop independent critical thinking, communication, and presentation skills, learn to work independently and build tolerance for obstacles, and make meaningful contributions to the broader scientific community of Quantum Computing Research. 

This program is intended to cultivate a group of mentors within the Quantum Collective who will have a chance to guide the program in later years and build on our core pillar of research to make the entry barrier into quantum computing accessible for undergraduate students.

# LOOKING FOR MENTORS!
We are looking for graduate mentors and faculty who are enthusiatic about meeting through-out the semester(virtual or in-person) to help guide passionate students in putting together their survery papers and help us create our topic proposals! At minimum, we are looking for mentors who are able to meet weekly/bi-weely with your research group. We also have a discord channel availble for our research group to keep you connected.

# Program Benefits:

- Understanding research methodology and how scientists work on problems
- Develop skills to analyze data and interpret results
- Learn to integrate theory and practice
- Develop knowledge about a subfield within Quantum Computing, as well as hands-on experience with quantum programming
- Gain transferrable skills for STEM research and professional careers
- Credibility with research experience for graduate programs
- Participate in conferences and any undergraduate research events at UT Austin as we incorporate opportunities throughout the year.
- Become a research mentor for the next wave of @paper-musketeers in the Quantum Collective

# Fall 2022:

Our goal is to submit survery papers for review by the end of the to Arxiv, if not sooner.

# Research Structure:

Students will be placed in groups of 4 or 5 depending on their research interests from the application form, and each team will work through the semester on their area of research. All groups will meet bi-weekly with our mentor to share our progress, roadblocks, and have a collective space for discussion. Each team will produce a survery paper based on your application area, learning how to create a framework for a testable experiment, implement your experiment on quantum simulators and/or hardware, as well as understand best practices for analyzing your data and synthesize your results. 

Teams will each have a forked repository in GitHub from our main repository. 

Teams will have a channel on the discord server and use #paper-musketeers for a collaborative discussion space.

Your mentor will be available on discord an as their schedule allows to help guide your research progress. 

We will try to work on bringing in more mentors throughout the year and make announcements accordingly. 

Learning resources will be provided in our resource repository to which all program participants will contribute together throughout the year.

# Expectations:

We understand that research as undergraduate research is a challenging initiative to contribute to while balancing classes. We will have no penalty nor required assignments and rely on our self-motivation and broader goal to contribute valuable scientific knowledge to the broader Quantum Computing research community. 

If at any time you feel like your research is overwhelming, please reach out to our mentor. We will determine the best steps forward for your teammates and adjust accordingly. 

We will also modify our timeline as needed based on our progress and check-in sessions.

We encourage this to be a welcoming space free from judgment and bias about your level of understanding. We are here to learn together regardless of where you start. 

# Opportunities:

Throughout the year, we will work to incorporate this program into any existing undergraduate research initiatives at UT Austin and beyond. This includes funding, conference opportunities, and any events at UT Austin where undergraduate research receives a space for disseminating your work.

# Program Timeline:

## August - Early September:

***Application and Introduction Period***

Research Introductions with The Quantum Collective at UT. Students spend this time meeting one another, thinking about their research goals and getting an overview of the program. Students will hear from other members about their experience and meet the mentor(s) for this academic year. Students will fill out an application form with their research interests, goals, and quantum computing experience.

## Mid-September - Early October:

***Program Initiation and Topic Research***

***Introduction to Quantum Computing Research and Program Overview***

*September 14th, 5:30 PM*

Enrolled students will meet their mentor and receive an introduction to research in the field of Quantum Computing. We will go over the program structure for the 6 months, our goals, expectations, and feedback as we develop the program. We will also hand off background materials for the selected topic.

**You may use this period to assess whether you feel ready to participate in our research program.**


***Design Thinking in Research and Introduction to Academic Writing***

*September 21st, 5:30 PM*

We will use this session to go over the basics of writing an academic paper, and introduce desing thinkng principles in stem to help guide the academic writing process. With your Dirac-tors, Michelle and Ronak

***Topic Review: Implementation walkthrough, and Team Assignments***

*September 28th, 5:30 PM*

In this session, we will go over an implementation of an algorithm of choice. Team assignments will be announced, and we will go over how each team will work together with their mentor. More learning resources will be given to your research team based on your area of application. We will give an introductory assignment for your team to learn about your area of specification.

***Group Check-in and Topic ***

*October 5th, 5:30 PM*

We will use this session as a time to check in about our progress and understanding to access the best next steps with our guidance. We will go over best practices for academic writing and our goals for your team to best incorporate your research into our paper.  

## October -  Late November:

***Progress check-ins and Open Forum Discussions***

*Bi-Weekly, 5:30 PM*

Throughout the remainder of the year, your mentor and Dirac-tors of research will meet bi-weekly with all research groups where each group will share progress, roadblocks, successes, and insights. This is intended to be a collaborative space where we encourage you all to ask questions and interactively share ideas to build each otherâ€™s knowledge. We will use these sessions to track our overall progress.

***Putting the Pieces Together***

*Late November, 5:30 PM*

In this session, we will go over best practices in writing up your experiment results, choosing quality results, and establishing interpretations from your data. We will focus this month on any roadblocks teams are facing and prioritize guidance in high-impact areas accordingly in order to write our final paper draft. 

***Final Preparations***

*Late November/December*

In this last month, we will focus on preparing our final research group poster presentations, cleanup our codebase for publication quality standards, and continue with finalizing our results as well as provide mentorship.

## S.Q.U.I.D Conference- FALL SEMESTER

Your groups will present your research! T.B.D On this because Iâ€™d like this to go towards the broader UT Community and any bigger events the Quantum Collective plans. As we establish the rest of our club schedule, more information on where and when will be released.

The S.Q.U.I.D Conference will be an event where students from all over will present their research at UT Austin! Present your work to our other Club members from the Quantum Coalition, which includes students at other universities from Berkekely, Yale, Oxford, and many more! We plan on bringing in our Quantum Partners (TBD)
